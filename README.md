# Employee-Account-Generator
#### Written Before App Was Created
A small app that creates an email address &amp; password for a (fictional) employee given their name &amp; department; complete with some homebrew validation measures.

#### Written After App Was Created
I started building this application after spending some time learning Java, and diving deeper into OOP than I had in my experiences with JS/TS. I initially planned on it 
being a command-line only app that I would spend no more than the weekend creating. When that first weekend was over, I wasn't satisfied with the app, and I wasn't comfortable 
calling myself a proficient novice with Java. A few weeks later, and the command-line only app has a JavaFX GUI, an SQL database, and many more features than I'd planned. 
Though I can absolutely declare that creating the app was invaluable as a learning tool, there are _many_ things that I'd do differently if I had to rebuild it from the 
ground up, the biggest thing being a strict adherence to the Model-View-Controller.
In sum, while I learned Java and SQL, and became **much** more comfortable with object-oriented programming than I was before, my biggest takeaway from this project was that 
systems like agile development exist for a reason. My harebrained decision to add a GUI after the core functionality was in place was akin to a customer changing their mind 
mid-project (though on a much smaller scale, of course). I can see how disorganized things can become without serious effort being put into keep things togetherâ€”and how much
time can be wasted keeping things contained on the fly.
